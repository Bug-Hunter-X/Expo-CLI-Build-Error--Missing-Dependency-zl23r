The issue was resolved by carefully examining the `package.json` file and the output of the `expo prebuild` command.  A missing dependency (`react-native-vector-icons`) was identified. The solution was to add the dependency to the `package.json` file and run `expo install react-native-vector-icons`. This process ensured the correct installation and integration of the required package, resolving the build error.
